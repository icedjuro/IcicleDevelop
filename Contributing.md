# Contributing

## Opening an issue
I'm accepting both feature requests and bug reports on issues. If you are making a feature request, please make it clear that it is a feature request and not a bug.

If you are reporting a bug, be as specific as possible: operating system, steps to reproduce, etc. Steps to reproduce should be as few steps as possible that can still reproduce the bug consistently. If you have any idea what may be causing the bug, include it.

## Developing
Make a fork of this repository and clone your fork. Make a new branch to implement your changes. Instructions on setting up and running IcicleDevelop from the source code can be found in the [README](README.md).

When you're done implementing your changes, run:
```
npm run test
```
This will run all the tests, which Jest will check and tell you if your tests passed. **If applicable: write new tests for the changes you made.**

### Opening a Pull Request
Make sure you describe what your pull request does with enough information that is needed. Also, make sure your branch is updated.
